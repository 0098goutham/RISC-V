# Overview DAY 2 ðŸš€
My learning experience from Day 2, which was the final day of the RISC-V Workshop. As a third-year ECE student, the workshop was an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into the world of RISC-V, VLSI tools, hardware programming, and open-source platforms. This hands-on experience has laid a strong foundation for my future explorations in this field.

## Day 2 Highlights
### 1. VLSI Tools
We explored tools used in Very Large Scale Integration, an essential aspect of designing and building modern integrated circuits. This helped me understand how hardware design transitions from abstract concepts to physical implementation.
### 2. Physical Design
Gained insights into the physical design workflows, which involve placing and routing components on a chip to optimize its performance and power usage.
### 3. Key Semiconductor Brands
Learned about industry leaders such as:
  TSMC: A leading semiconductor foundry renowned for its advanced chip manufacturing technologies.
  AMD: Known for its cutting-edge processors and graphics cards.
  Intel: A pioneer in CPUs and data center technologies.
  NVIDIA: A leader in GPUs and AI hardware solutions.
  Qualcomm: Dominating mobile and wireless technology markets.
    Understanding the contributions of these companies gave me a clearer picture of the semiconductor ecosystem and its impact on global technology.
### 4. EDA Software
Explored Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools that simplify the process of designing chips. These tools enable engineers to model, simulate, and verify circuit designs efficiently.
### 5. Open Source Platforms
We had discussions on the importance of open-source hardware and software platforms, which foster collaboration and innovation while making advanced technologies accessible to everyone.
### 6. IP & Protocols
Understood the significance of intellectual property (IP) in chip design, and how protocols ensure seamless communication between hardware and software components.
### 7. C Programming Projects
Worked on a Counter Program, implementing it on both RISC-V architecture and regular architecture. This hands-on coding exercise allowed me to compare the performance and behavior of different architectures.
### 8. VSDSQUADRON MINI Board
Got the exciting chance to work with the VSDSQUADRON MINI board, a powerful tool for RISC-V development.
Ran and tested a few basic C programs on the board.
Learned how to interact with the hardware and analyze outputs.
### 9. RISC-V Hands-On Experience
Wrote and executed RISC-V programs on the development board.
Explored registers, memory operations, and peripheral interfacing.
Debugged programs in real time and resolved issues, which enhanced my practical skills and understanding of RISC-V applications.
### 10. x86 and ARM Architectures
We discussed the basics of these popular architectures:
x86: Used in desktops and servers, known for its powerful computing capabilities.
ARM: Dominates mobile and embedded systems, offering energy-efficient solutions.

## Career Opportunities
The day concluded with inspiring discussions on career paths in open-source hardware development, highlighting the possibilities and growth in this field. It was an eye-opener and fueled my passion for exploring hardware technologies further.
